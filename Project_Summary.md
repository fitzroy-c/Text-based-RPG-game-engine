Project Summary:



- to operate or test the game correctly, you need to add gson-2.8.6(from google) and fastjson-1.2.75(from alibaba)

- The card package, map package, gui package and DesignForFutureExtension package are used for game's future extension.

Summary on applications of knowledge in this course:
    - tokenizer and parser
    - unit testing(include both white box testing and black box testing)
    - appropriate applications of different data structure(e.g. hashMap, hashset, tree structure...)
    - abstract class, inherit, interface(change to inherit in the final version) to enlarge the expandability.
    - the extensive application of Json as a persistent data storage
Thanks:
- During our development, we encountered a lot of difficulties in the middle, and this open source project (https://github.com/Progether/JAdventure) gives us great inspiration on what a textbased game should look like.
