# 2100 Group Project

# We created a Java text based, single player adventure game.
## In the game, you can:

1. walk around freely on our map!
2. explore different items and treasure on our map!
3. defeat powerful monsters and bosses to make you stronger!
4. talk to the guide if you get lost and don't know where to start.
5. get all your needs from wandering merchants scattering on the map!
6. and a lot more for you to explore!!!
